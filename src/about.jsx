      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        A Computer Scientist with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science, 
        I possess a solid foundation in computing principles, systems, and 
        problem-solving. My academic background, combined with practical 
        experience, enables me to design and deliver smart, technology-driven
         solutions across different domains.

        As a Data Analyst and Machine Learning Engineer, I am passionate 
        about turning data into actionable insights that empower businesses 
        and organizations. With expertise in SQL, Python, Excel, and modern ML
         libraries, I build solutions that not only explain past and present 
         
         trends but also predict future outcomes, helping teams make informed, 
         data-driven decisions.

        In addition to analytics, I work as an IT Consultant, supporting businesses
         in leveraging digital tools, optimizing workflows, and implementing strategies
          that bridge the gap between technology and organizational needs.

        By combining technical expertise, analytical thinking, and consulting 
        experience, I deliver value that drives growth, innovation, and efficiency.
         My ultimate focus is on enabling businesses and individuals to make smarter
          decisions and achieve lasting impact through technology.
